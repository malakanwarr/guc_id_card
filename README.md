# GUC ID Card

This is my **first Flutter project** — a simple mobile app that visually displays a digital version of my university ID.

## 📱 App Overview

The app simulates a student ID card for the **German University in Cairo (GUC)**. It includes:

- 🧑‍🎓 **Student Name**
- 🆔 **University ID**
- 📧 **Email Address**
- 🎓 **Major/Department**
- 🖼️ A circular avatar or profile image (optional)

Everything is laid out using Flutter's powerful `Column`, `Row`, and `Card` widgets for a clean and responsive UI.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Flutter** (Dart)
- Stateless and Stateful Widgets
- Material Design components
- Live hot reload development

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Setting up a Flutter environment on macOS
- Running Flutter apps on the iOS simulator
- Designing UI with Flutter's widget tree
- Using `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, `Text`, and `Image` widgets
- Managing project structure and GitHub integration
